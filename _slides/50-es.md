# Event Sourcing

-----
# An Event
- Represents a state change of the system
- Very carefully named in passed tense
  * Ubiquitous language
  * Donâ€™t be CRUDy
  * Event != Entity 
- Is imutable !

note:
Do you a favor : Keep it's structure as simple as you can, you'll have to manage versioning on Events.
ex :
- UserAdressChanged => UserRelocated
- UserRemoved => UserExcluded / UserSubscriptionEnded ...

Notes:
- there is no eraser in those pictures.
- erasing or changing is not a thing in some industries (banking for example) => regulation / auditability.
- we do not change the past, same as real world.
- if we fucked up, we correct it by registering some correction event.

## Aggregates & Streams

#### An Aggregate
- Is the business Entity
- has a state
- handle a Command
- produce/emit 0-N Events
- apply those events <br/> to its state

</div>

Notes:
The handle/decide method:
- can decide to do nothing
- can decide to return an error
- can have dependencies
- Should never-ever-ever mutate the state !

The apply method:
- Is pure deterministic function state + event => state
- have **NO** dependencies (not even Datetime.Now)
- Will be called to hydrade the aggregate on the next command handle
- Should never-ever-ever fail !

---
#### A Stream
- Store all events for **1 aggregate**
- In order !


-----
## The Event Store

- is the source of all truth
- has a very simple schema : [StreamId, EventNumber, EventName, EventPayload]
- can be append only, **no update or delete** required
- Store events **in order** for each streams
- Guarantees transaction on a single stream
- Is fast to query on a single stream,
  * in **EventNumber** ascending order,
  * and from a given position/EventNumber.

---
## ES : Bonus points

- should be able to give an aggregated log of all streams 
- great if you can re-partition streams according to projections needs

# Super powers ?

---
## You can get super specialized read models

---
## You don't loose information

insert cart example

---
## Time machine

You can 

---
## You have audit for free

The event store is basically an audit log.
  ## Magic features
  - Super specialized read models
  - Audit for free
  - Business trace for free
  - Time machine 
  - Easy to scale
---
## BDD Testing is really stupid simple

Given:
- An Aggregate
- Some (mocked) dependencies
- A list of past events

When
- A Command

Then
- A list of Events
- or an Error

Notes:
At BeezUP we write those tests in yaml documents.

## Eventual consistency

The read model can be late, you have to think about at all the time.

---
## Idempotency

Most of the time you'll get events "once".

If you think it's guaranteed, sometimes you'll get pretty weird bugs. 

Notes:
- it's no slow to checkpoints each event.
- you can distribute charge accros multiple consumers, sometimes they can receive the same event.
  
--- 
## Ordering

What if you don't get events in the correct order ?

(ex : in case of a redelivery)

Notes:
Multiple strategies :
- save version on the readmodel
- save latest projected event epoch
- don't care !
...
Depend off the targeted read model !

## Split brains

Distinct projections can have distinct delays ...
